# Shared helpers for the Java analyzers. They each extend `Analyzer`
# directly rather than a language-specific engine (historically the
# Java set was the first family to land and never got an intermediate
# class), so the helpers live as class methods on the JavaEngine
# module and the callers import it explicitly. Mirrors the pattern
# `Analyzer::Kotlin::KotlinEngine` follows.

    # Maven/Gradle pin test sources to `src/test/<lang>/` — `java`,
    # `kotlin`, `scala`, `groovy` all share the layout. Real route
    # handlers never live there, but Quarkus, Micronaut, Spring,
    # Javalin, JAX-RS and friends routinely declare inline
    # controllers under `src/test/java/...` to exercise the
    # framework. The path layout is part of the build tool's
    # contract so the prefix check is unambiguous.
    #
    # Also covers Maven's archetype source-roots
    # (`src/it/`, integration-test convention used by some Quarkus
    # extensions and Apache projects) which sit alongside `src/test/`.
