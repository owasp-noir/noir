By leveraging AI, Noir can often identify endpoints in languages and frameworks that it doesn't natively support, and can provide additional insights into the functionality of your application.\n\nHow to Use the AI Integration\nTo enable AI-powered analysis, you need to specify an AI provider, a model, and an API key.\n\nCommand-Line Flags\n\n--ai-provider: The AI provider you want to use. This can be a preset prefix (like openai or ollama) or the full URL of a custom API endpoint.\n--ai-model: The name of the model you want to use for the analysis (e.g., gpt-4o).\n--ai-key: Your API key for the AI provider. You can also set this using the NOIR_AI_KEY environment variable.\n--ai-max-token: (Optional) The maximum number of tokens to use for AI requests. This can affect the length of the generated text.\n--cache-disable: Disable the on-disk LLM cache for this run.\n--cache-clear: Clear the LLM cache directory before the run.\n\nBy default, Noir caches AI responses on disk to speed up repeated analyses and reduce costs. Use the cache flags above to bypass or purge the cache when needed.\nSupported AI Providers\nNoir has built-in presets for several popular AI providers:\nPrefixDefault Host\nopenaihttps://api.openai.com\nxaihttps://api.x.ai\ngithubhttps://models.github.ai\nazurehttps://models.inference.ai.azure.com\nvllmhttp://localhost:8000\nollamahttp://localhost:11434\nlmstudiohttp://localhost:1234\n\nIf you are using a provider that is not on this list, you can provide the full URL to its API endpoint, for example: --ai-provider=http://my-custom-api:9000.\nBenefits and Considerations\n\nExpanded Support: LLMs can help Noir analyze frameworks and languages that are not yet natively supported.\nDeeper Insights: AI models can often identify subtle or complex endpoints that might be missed by traditional static analysis.\nPotential Downsides: Be aware that AI analysis can sometimes produce false positives (hallucinations) and may be slower than a standard scan, depending on the model and hardware.\n\nBy integrating AI into your workflow, you can significantly enhance Noir's analytical capabilities and gain a more comprehensive understanding of your codebase.\n","id":"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/get_started/ai-power/","title":"AI-Powered Analysis"},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/get_started/installation/":{"body":"There are several ways to install OWASP Noir, so you can choose the method that works best for your operating system and workflow.\nHomebrew (macOS and Linux)\nIf you are on macOS or Linux, the easiest way to install Noir is with Homebrew.\n\n\n  For Homebrew users, shell completions for Zsh, Bash, and Fish are automatically installed, so you can start using them right away.\n\nSnapcraft (Linux)\nIf you are on a Linux distribution that supports Snap, you can install Noir from the Snap Store.\n\nDocker\nIf you prefer to use Docker, you can pull the official Noir image from the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).\n\nYou can find a list of all available tags on the GitHub Packages page.\nBuild from Source\n\n  If you want to build Noir from source, you will need to have the Crystal programming language installed.\n\n\n\nClone the repository:\n\n\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n\n\nBuild the project:\n\nThe compiled binary will be located at ./bin/noir.\n\n\nVerifying the Installation\nOnce you have installed Noir, you can verify that it is working correctly by running:\n\nThis should print the installed version of Noir.\n","id":"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/get_started/installation/","title":"Installation"},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/get_started/overview/":{"body":"OWASP Noir is an open-source tool designed to help security professionals and developers identify the attack surface of their applications. By performing static analysis on source code, Noir can discover API endpoints, web pages, and other potential entry points that could be targeted by attackers.\nThis makes it an invaluable tool for white-box security testing and for building robust security pipelines.\nGitHub | OWASP Project Page\n\nHow It Works\nNoir is built with the Crystal programming language and is composed of several key components that work together to analyze code:\n\nDetectors: Identify the technologies used in a codebase.\nAnalyzers: Parse the code to find endpoints, parameters, and other interesting information.\nPassive Scanner &amp; Tagger: Use rules to identify potential vulnerabilities and add contextual tags to the findings.\nDeliver: Send the results to other tools for further analysis.\nOutput Builder: Generate reports in various formats.\n\n\nProject Goals\nThe primary goal of Noir is to bridge the gap between static code analysis and dynamic security testing. By providing a comprehensive and accurate list of an application's endpoints, Noir enables DAST tools to perform more thorough and effective scans.\nIn the future, we plan to expand our support for more languages and frameworks, improve the accuracy of our analysis, and further leverage AI and LLMs to enhance our capabilities.\nContributing\nOWASP Noir is an open-source project that thrives on community contributions.

You can provide a comma-separated list (e.g., rails,django).\n--exclude-techs &lt;TECHS&gt;: Tell Noir to exclude the specified technologies from the scan.\n--list-techs: Show a list of all the technologies that Noir supports.\n\nExample: Focusing on a Single Technology\nTo scan a directory but only look for code related to Ruby on Rails, you would use the --techs flag:\n\nExample: Excluding a Technology\nIf you have a project that contains both PHP and JavaScript code, but you only want to see the results for PHP, you could exclude JavaScript:\n\nListing Available Technologies\nTo see a full list of all the technologies that Noir can recognize, use the --list-techs flag:\n\nBy using these commands, you can fine-tune your scans to get the most relevant results for your specific needs.\n","id":"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/supported/tech-commands/","title":"Managing Technology Scopes"}},"docInfo":{"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/community/":{"body":54,"title":1},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/community/articles/":{"body":81,"title":3},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/community/contributions/":{"body":144,"title":2},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/get_started/":{"body":61,"title":2},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/get_started/ai-power/":{"body":218,"title":3},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/get_started/installation/":{"body":98,"title":1},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/get_started/overview/":{"body":201,"title":1},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/get_started/running/":{"body":73,"title":2},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/resoruces/":{"body":28,"title":1},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/resoruces/contact/":{"body":61,"title":1},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/resoruces/faq/":{"body":71,"title":1},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/resoruces/hidden-flags/":{"body":198,"title":2},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/resoruces/release-procedure/":{"body":173,"title":2},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/":{"body":77,"title":2},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/ai_providers/":{"body":61,"title":2},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/ai_providers/github-marketplace/":{"body":117,"title":5},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/ai_providers/lmstudio/":{"body":119,"title":4},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/ai_providers/ollama/":{"body":164,"title":3},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/ai_providers/openai/":{"body":145,"title":3},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/ai_providers/vllm/":{"body":142,"title":3},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/ai_providers/xai/":{"body":138,"title":3},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/configurations/":{"body":60,"title":1},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/configurations/configuration-file/":{"body":116,"title":3},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/configurations/shell-completion/":{"body":120,"title":2},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/github_action/":{"body":379,"title":2},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/more_features/":{"body":71,"title":2},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/more_features/deliver/":{"body":232,"title":3},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/more_features/diff/":{"body":119,"title":4},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/more_features/pipeline-for-dast/":{"body":149,"title":4},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/more_features/tagger/":{"body":115,"title":4},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/output_formats/":{"body":103,"title":2},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/output_formats/curl/":{"body":100,"title":3},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/output_formats/json/":{"body":103,"title":2},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/output_formats/mermaid/":{"body":135,"title":2},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/output_formats/more/":{"body":126,"title":3},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/output_formats/openapi/":{"body":90,"title":2},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/output_formats/sarif/":{"body":258,"title":1},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/output_formats/yaml/":{"body":103,"title":1},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/passive_scan/":{"body":223,"title":3},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/passive_scan/community-rules/":{"body":105,"title":5},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/passive_scan/default-rules/":{"body":203,"title":4},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/passive_scan/rule/":{"body":4,"title":3},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/supported/":{"body":51,"title":2},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/supported/language-and-frameworks/":{"body":108,"title":3},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/supported/specification/":{"body":47,"title":2},"https://owasp-noir.github.io/noir/usage/supported/tech-commands/":{"body":145,"title":3}},"length":47},"lang":"English"}
