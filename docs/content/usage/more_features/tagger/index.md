Automatically add descriptive tags to endpoints and parameters to flag functionality and potential security risks (e.g., SQL injection, authentication endpoints).

## Usage

Tagger is disabled by default.

**Enable all taggers**

```bash
noir scan <BASE_PATH> -T
```

**Enable specific taggers** (list available ones with `noir list taggers`)

```bash
noir scan <BASE_PATH> --use-taggers hunt,oauth
```

## Output

Tags appear in the `tags` array at both the endpoint level and the parameter level. Each tag has a `name` (short identifier like `sqli` or `oauth`), a human-readable `description`, and the `tagger` that produced it (e.g., `Hunt` for vulnerability patterns, `Oauth` for authentication flows).

```json
{
  "url": "/query",
  "method": "POST",
  "params": [
    {
      "name": "query",
      "value": "",
      "param_type": "form",
      "tags": [
        {
          "name": "sqli",
          "description": "This parameter may be vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.",
          "tagger": "Hunt"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "protocol": "http",
  "tags": []
},
{
  "url": "/token",
  "method": "GET",
  "protocol": "http",
  "tags": [
    {
      "name": "oauth",
      "description": "Suspected OAuth endpoint for granting 3rd party access.",
      "tagger": "Oauth"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Tag categories

Taggers span several kinds of security-relevant signal. Run `noir list taggers` for the full, up-to-date list.

- **Parameter vulnerability classes** — `hunt` flags individual parameters that match known-risky names (`sqli`, `ssrf`, `idor`, `file-inclusion`, `command-injection`, …).
- **Protocol / interface** — `graphql`, `soap`, `websocket`, `mcp`, `cors`.
- **Authentication & tokens** — `oauth`, `jwt`, plus the framework-aware auth taggers (Spring Security, Django, Express, …).
- **Endpoint sensitivity & purpose** — classify *what an endpoint is for* so reviewers can prioritize the highest-stakes surface:
  - `pii` — handles personally identifiable information (SSN, card data, contact details); review for data exposure and over-collection.
  - `admin` — administrative or privileged routes (`/admin`, privilege-mutating parameters); prime targets for broken access control and privilege escalation.
  - `payment` — payment / financial transaction endpoints; review for amount/price tampering, currency confusion, and IDOR on financial records.
  - `webhook` — inbound webhook / callback endpoints; verify signature validation, replay protection, and SSRF on outbound calls.
  - `crypto` — cryptographic operation endpoints (encryption/decryption, signing, hashing, key management); review for weak or obsolete algorithms, padding/signing oracles, static IV/salt reuse, and key exposure.
  - `debug` — debug, diagnostic, and internal-only endpoints (debug consoles/toggles, profilers, actuator/management, pprof, heap/thread dumps, `/internal` APIs); should not be publicly reachable — review for information exposure and unsafe diagnostic actions.
  - `api_docs` — API documentation / schema endpoints (Swagger, OpenAPI, GraphiQL, ReDoc, WSDL); expose the full API surface and are frequently unauthenticated — review for unauthenticated exposure and information disclosure.
  - `account_recovery` — credential-management and account-recovery endpoints (password reset/change, email change, MFA/OTP, verification); the classic account-takeover surface — review for reset-token leakage, host-header injection in reset links, account enumeration, and missing rate limiting.
  - `file_upload` — file upload endpoints; review for unrestricted upload, path traversal, and malicious file handling.
- **Framework-specific protections & risks** — framework-aware taggers that flag a framework's security controls and *deviations from its secure defaults* on the endpoints they affect. For Rails (`rails_security`):
  - `csrf-protection` — CSRF verification disabled (`skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token`, `skip_forgery_protection`) or downgraded (`protect_from_forgery with: :null_session`); Rails protects state-changing requests by default, so an explicit opt-out is the case worth reviewing.
  - `mass-assignment` — Strong Parameters bypassed (`params.permit!`, `params.to_unsafe_h`, or a raw `params[:x]` hash passed to a model writer such as `Model.new(params[:user])`); review for attacker-controlled attribute writes (privilege flags, ownership columns).
  - `rate-limit` — actions throttled by the Rails 8 native `rate_limit` macro; useful context when assessing brute-force / abuse exposure (and its absence on auth/recovery surface is itself a finding).

  For Spring (`spring_security`), complementing the `spring_auth` authentication tagger:
  - `csrf-protection` — CSRF turned off in a `SecurityFilterChain`, either wholesale (`csrf().disable()`, `csrf(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable)`, Kotlin `csrf { disable() }`) or selectively for specific paths (`csrf(c -> c.ignoringRequestMatchers("/api/**"))`), reported on the state-changing endpoints (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) affected; common for stateless/token APIs but always worth surfacing, and scoped to a chain's `securityMatcher` when present.
  - `cors` — a `@CrossOrigin` annotation on the handler/controller, or a global `WebMvcConfigurer` mapping (`addMapping(...).allowedOrigins("*")`), opts the endpoint out of the browser same-origin default; wildcard origins (`*`), especially combined with credentials, are called out as permissive.
  - `security-headers` — Spring's default response-header protections weakened: clickjacking off (`frameOptions().disable()`) or the whole header writer disabled (`headers().disable()` / `headers(HeadersConfigurer::disable)`).
  - `input-validation` — `@Valid` / `@Validated` applies Bean Validation to the request payload; surfacing where it *is* applied also makes the gaps (handlers taking a `@RequestBody` without it) visible by their absence.

  For Rust web frameworks (`rust_security`, covering Actix-Web, Axum/tower-http, Rocket, Loco, Warp, …) — Rust has no implicit secure defaults, so the tagger records the protections actually wired up (via `.wrap(..)`/`.layer(..)` middleware, or Loco's `config/*.yaml`) and flags the dangerous configurations:
  - `cors` — CORS middleware. Permissive configs (`Cors::permissive()`, `CorsLayer::very_permissive()`, `allow_any_origin`, `allow_origins: ["*"]`) are flagged as a risk; restricted allow-lists are recorded as informational.
  - `rate-limit` — request throttling (`actix-governor`, `tower_governor`, `actix-limitation`, tower's limit layers); maps onto the scope it wraps, so you can see which routes are *not* protected.
  - `security-headers` — hardening response headers set on the route (HSTS, CSP, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, …).
  - `body-limit` — request body size cap (DoS mitigation); a disabled limit (`DefaultBodyLimit::disable()`) is flagged as a risk.

Endpoint-level tags also feed the AI context as signals, enriching the per-endpoint summary that AI reviewers consume.
